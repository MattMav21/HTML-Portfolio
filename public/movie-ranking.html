    <h1>Matthew's Favorite Movies</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Favorite Movies</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire</h3>
    <p>I loved this movie because it felt like it was the most dramatic one in the Harry Potter series.</p>
    <h3>Borat</h3>
    <p>It has my sense of humor: it's wacky, crude, and over-the-top</p>
    <h3>The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy: Big Boogie Adventure</h3>
    <p>Billy & Mandy was one of my favorite shows growing up.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Random Haiku</h2>
    <p>
        This is a haiku <br>
        I don't know why I typed it. <br>
        I guess it's just here <br>

    <h2>My Goals</h2>
    <h3>1. Why do I want to learn this skill?</h3>
    <p>What does it mean to you? What are your motivations? Will you prove something to yourself or
        people around you? Will you get a raise because you’re better at your job or will you get a better job?
    </p>
    <h4>
        Learning this skill shows myself that I am capabale of complex problem-solving and creativity. My motivations for
        learning coding are that I can have a very nice, stable career if I know how to market myself.
    </h4>
    <br>
    
    <h3>2. What will I achieve if I learn this skill?</h3>
    <p>Which doors will this skill open for you? Will you be able to earn more, have more flexibility in your
        work hours, work remotely and travel more?
    </p>
    <h4>
        I will be able to obtain my first software engineer job. In turn, I will be able to make more money, possibly even
        work remote!
    </h4>
    <br>
    
    <h3>3. How will this skill change my life and my career?</h3>
    <p>Would you get a raise at your current job or more respect from your boss once you’ve learnt this skill?
        Or will you be at Facebook, Amazon or Google instead? How would your life change?
    </p>
    <h4>
        Ideally, regardless of whether I work for the same company I do now or move on to a different company, I will be
        able to have a career in programming. Financial stability and security will much more likely be attained.
    </h4>
    <br>
    
    <h3>4. How will learning this skill impact the lives of my family,
        friends and coworkers?</h3>
    <p>What will you be able to do for your family or friends once you’ve learnt this skill? How will it change
        the way they think of you? Will your coworkers respect you more?
    </p>
    <h4>
        I think people will be able to see that I am indeed creative and intelligent. Plus, they'll be interested in what
        else I could program!
    </h4>
    <br>
    
    <h3>5. How will I feel if I never accomplish this?</h3>
    <p>Would you feel disappointed? Would you feel like you’ve missed out?
    </p>
    <h4>
        Simply, I would continue feeling like I am going nowhere in life.
    </h4>
    <br>
    
    <h3>6. What would my life look like if I manage to accomplish this?</h3>
    <p>Visualise it. What would life look like from the moment you wake up to the time you go to sleep? Will
        you be living by the sea? Would you kiss your beautiful wife/husband when you wake up
    </p>
    <h4>
        To be honest, I'd still live life the way I'm living it now. The only difference would be that I would never have to
        fear being homeless and being unstable again.
